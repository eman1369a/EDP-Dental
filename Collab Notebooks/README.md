## Gaps In Time

This Python script takes a call log CSV file as input and outputs a new CSV file that includes breaks between calls. It calculates the start and end times of each call and the duration of each break. The output file also includes a new column for the duration of each call and the duration of each break in minutes.

This script is useful for call centers or businesses that need to track the duration of calls and breaks for their employees. By using this script, managers can get a more accurate picture of how much time their employees are spending on calls and breaks, and can use this information to optimize their workflows and increase efficiency.

The script uses the Pandas library to read in and manipulate the data, and includes comments throughout the code to explain each step of the process. It also includes error handling to ensure that the script runs smoothly and can handle missing or incomplete data.

This script can be easily adapted and customized to meet the specific needs of different businesses or organizations. It can also be integrated into larger data analysis workflows or combined with other scripts to create more complex analyses.

## Clean Phoneburner Data for CRM

This Python script demonstrates strong data wrangling skills by processing a dataset containing contact information for dental practices. The script cleans the data by removing empty phone numbers, converting phone numbers to a standardized format, filling in missing values, and categorizing specialties. It also applies a function to assign territories based on the state of the dental practice and generates campaign names accordingly. In addition, the script cleans up the "Attn To" field by removing unnecessary characters and standardizing the formatting. This script showcases the use of Pandas, regex, and lambda functions to efficiently clean and transform a large dataset, making it a valuable asset for any company that deals with large amounts of data.

## New Referring Offices 

This Python script processes two CSV files, one containing information on new dental offices and one containing information on referrals made by those offices. It calculates the number of new offices and referrals made by territory and by rep, and outputs the results to Excel files. The script is designed to be run locally and requires the pandas and openpyxl packages.

## Sales By Weekday
Weekly Sales Analysis is a Python script that analyzes sales data for a business on a weekly basis. The script reads in multiple CSV files containing sales data for individual days, combines them into a single DataFrame, and performs various calculations and visualizations on the data. The script uses the pandas and matplotlib libraries to manipulate and plot the data.

## Sales Forecasting using ARIMA Model: 
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to forecast daily sales data using an ARIMA model in Python. The notebook includes data preprocessing steps, visualizations, and the implementation of the ARIMA model using the statsmodels and pmdarima libraries. The results of the model are evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), and the predicted values are plotted against the actual values for visualization. This notebook can serve as a reference for anyone interested in using ARIMA models for sales forecasting.
