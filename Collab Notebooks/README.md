Gaps In Time

This Python script takes a call log CSV file as input and outputs a new CSV file that includes breaks between calls. It calculates the start and end times of each call and the duration of each break. The output file also includes a new column for the duration of each call and the duration of each break in minutes.

This script is useful for call centers or businesses that need to track the duration of calls and breaks for their employees. By using this script, managers can get a more accurate picture of how much time their employees are spending on calls and breaks, and can use this information to optimize their workflows and increase efficiency.

The script uses the Pandas library to read in and manipulate the data, and includes comments throughout the code to explain each step of the process. It also includes error handling to ensure that the script runs smoothly and can handle missing or incomplete data.

This script can be easily adapted and customized to meet the specific needs of different businesses or organizations. It can also be integrated into larger data analysis workflows or combined with other scripts to create more complex analyses.
