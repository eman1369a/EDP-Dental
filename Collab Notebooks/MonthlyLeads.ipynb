It provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to input the names and lead quotas of your sales team members, and then assigns the leads accordingly.\n","\n","##Purpose\n","The primary goal of this script is to streamline the lead assignment process and ensure that the sales representatives receive their leads based on predetermined conditions. This helps to maintain a fair distribution of leads and maximizes the efficiency of the sales team.\n","\n","##How to use\n","To use this script, simply provide a list of sales representatives along with their desired lead counts, and the script will automatically distribute the leads based on the specified rules.\n","\n","##Conditional rules\n","The script follows a set of predefined rules for assigning leads to the sales representatives. These rules are:\n","\n","- Cindy has priority in receiving leads. She is assigned 500 leads, starting with the Household plans. Any remaining leads up to her quota of 500 are filled with Couple Plan leads.\n","- Patricia is assigned EDP Dental Plan leads as her primary focus.\n","- Debbie has a cap on the number of Couple Plan leads she can receive.\n","- All other sales representatives are assigned the remaining Couple Plan leads, divided equally among them.\n","\n","\n","Please note that these rules are specific to this implementation and can be customized according to your organization's needs."],"metadata":{"id":"34R6L8OBQZi7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dependencies\n","\n","This script requires the following libraries to be installed:\n","\n","- pandas\n","- PyQT5\n","- argparse\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ov1UyYf_S0Aa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#!pip install PyQT5\n","#!pip install pandas\n","#!pip install argparse"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8jC3gqatFX1m","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679682646883,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4799,"user":{"displayName":"Emanuel Lopez","userId":"07589255388788496260"}},"outputId":"5e2e7a1e-e847-4a36-8038-7602f282dc86"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: PyQT5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (5.15.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: PyQt5-Qt5>=5.15.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from PyQT5) (5.15.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: PyQt5-sip<13,>=12.11 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from PyQT5) (12.11.1)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","import argparse\n","from PyQt5.QtWidgets import (\n","    QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, QLabel, QLineEdit, QPushButton, QFileDialog, QMessageBox\n",")\n","\n","def assign_leads(df, dicto, debcop):\n","    #
